# Spring Annotation Cheat Sheet

Spring provides numerous annotations, which can be categorized based on different functionalities. These annotations can be a part of the core Spring Framework, specialized for REST services, or be tailored for specific Spring modules. Below is an organized list of Spring annotations, grouped into categories for better understanding and usage.

## Spring Framework

The Spring Framework is the core project within the Spring ecosystem. It offers various annotations for dependency injection, configuration, JMS, and more.

### Dependency Injection

Spring’s Dependency Injection (DI) annotations are used for managing the automatic injection of dependencies in beans. The common DI annotations include:

- [@Resource](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-resource-annotation): Injects the requested resource.
- [@Autowired](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-autowired-annotation): A widely used DI mechanism for constructors, methods, and interfaces.
- [@Inject](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-inject-named): Another DI mechanism that can replace `@Autowired`. 
- [@Named](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-inject-named): A DI mechanism that can replace `@Autowired` and `@Inject`.
- [@ManagedBean](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-named): Similar to `@Named` and `@Component` but not composable.
- [@Value](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Value.html): Injects a default value for fields or methods, often used for property files.
- [@Required](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/index.html?org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Required.html): Marks a method as required to be injected with a dependency.
- [@Primary](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-autowired-annotation-primary): Marks a bean as a preference when multiple beans are candidates for autowiring.
- [@Component](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-stereotype-annotations): A generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
- [@Service](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-stereotype-annotations): Marks a class as a service in Spring.
- [@Import](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-java-using-import): Loads `@Bean` definitions from other configuration classes.
- [@DependsOn](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/DependsOn.html): Specifies beans that the current bean depends on.
- [@ConstructorProperties](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-factory-collaborators): Names the constructor arguments.
- [@Lookup](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Lookup.html): Marks lookup methods for dynamic bean injection.

### Configuration

Spring’s configuration annotations are used to configure Spring beans and enable various features. These annotations include:

- [@ComponentScan](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ComponentScan.html): Configures component scanning directives for `@Configuration` classes.
- [@Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-java-basic-concepts): Marks a class as a source of bean definitions.

- [@Qualifier](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-autowired-annotation-qualifiers): Associates a value with a particular argument to fine-tune the injection.
- [@Profile](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-definition-profiles): Indicates the active profiles for a component.
- [@Conditional](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-java-using-import): Registers a bean only when specific conditions are met.
- [@ImportResource](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-java-using-import): Imports XML configuration files.
- [@EnableLoadTimeWeaving](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#context-load-time-weaver): Enables load-time weaving for dynamic class transformation.
- [@EventListener](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#context-functionality-events-annotation): Registers an event listener on a method of a bean.
- [@Async](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#context-functionality-events-async): Marks a method as asynchronous.
- [@PropertySource](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/PropertySource.html): Adds a property source to Spring’s environment.

### JMS (Java Message Service)

Spring’s JMS annotations are used to handle messaging, enabling integration with JMS systems.

- [@EnableJms](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/jms.html#jms-annotated-support): Enables support for `@JmsListener` annotations.
- [@JmsListener](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/jms.html#jms-mdp): Marks a method as a JMS listener endpoint.
- [@JmsListeners](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/annotation/JmsListeners.html): Aggregates multiple `@JmsListener` annotations.
- [@Payload](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/jms.html#jms-annotated-response): Indicates the payload of a message.
- [@SendTo](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/jms.html#jms-annotated-response): Defines where the response to a message should be sent.

### AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol)

Spring AMQP annotations enable the integration of AMQP-based messaging systems, such as RabbitMQ.

- [@Queue](https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/docs/current/api/org/springframework/amqp/rabbit/annotation/Queue.html): Defines a queue in an `@QueueBinding`.
- [@QueueBinding](https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/docs/current/api/org/springframework/amqp/rabbit/annotation/QueueBinding.html): Defines a queue, the exchange, and the binding key.
- [@Exchange](https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/docs/current/api/org/springframework/amqp/rabbit/annotation/Exchange.html): Defines the exchange for a queue binding.
